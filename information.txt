INFORMATION FOR THIS PROJECT

This project is to build a high-end, OS-inspired personal portfolio website for “Dzakwan — Frontend & Mobile Engineer”. The goal is to recreate a realistic desktop-like operating system environment inside a browser, not as a gimmick, but as a fully interactive UI system with window management, dock, spotlight search, context menus, keyboard shortcuts, split panels, draggable and resizable windows, layered z-index control, persistent layout memory, and polished animations.

This is not a basic portfolio. This is a simulated desktop UI environment engineered as a web application.

The design direction is “Soft Cream Minimal OS” — warm, premium, calm, and elegant. It must not copy macOS UI directly, but reinterpret the concept into a refined cream/beige aesthetic with subtle depth, muted accent colors, and clean editorial typography.

The system must feel intelligent, fluid, intentional, and engineered with care.

CORE TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Framework & Runtime:

Next.js (latest stable version)

React (latest stable version)

TypeScript (strict mode enabled)

pnpm as package manager

Styling:

Tailwind CSS

tailwindcss-animate

CSS variables for theme tokens

class-variance-authority (CVA)

tailwind-merge

clsx

Motion & Animation:

Framer Motion (for spring-based animations, window transitions, dock hover magnification, fade/scale transitions, layout transitions)

State Management:

Zustand (for window manager, app registry, focus state, layout state, desktop configuration, active windows, minimized windows)

Zustand persist middleware

OS-LIKE UI FOUNDATION (CRITICAL LIBRARIES)

Component Primitives:

Radix UI (DropdownMenu, ContextMenu, Dialog, Tooltip, Popover, Tabs, Menubar, ScrollArea, Separator)

shadcn/ui (as a component layer built on top of Radix)

lucide-react (icons)

Command System:

cmdk (for Spotlight-style command palette)

Fuse.js (for fuzzy searching apps, projects, files)

Window System:

react-rnd (draggable + resizable windows)

Custom snap logic (left half, right half, maximize, restore)

Z-index layering system

Layout System:

react-resizable-panels (Finder-like sidebar + main panel split)

Optional: @use-gesture/react for advanced gesture behavior

Keyboard Shortcuts:

react-hotkeys-hook or tinykeys

Notifications:

sonner (toast notifications)

Data Persistence:

Dexie.js (IndexedDB) for:

Desktop layout

Window positions

User preferences

Theme settings

Recently opened apps

Search & Indexing:

Fuse.js for fuzzy search inside spotlight

Optional Advanced Desktop Features:

react-selecto (drag-to-select desktop items)

moveable (if advanced interaction needed)

react-virtuoso (virtualized list for project tables)

Theme Management:

next-themes (for soft cream / dark mode toggle)

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

This project must implement a modular OS-like structure:

AppRegistry (metadata for each app)

WindowManager (open, close, minimize, maximize, focus, snap, restore)

Desktop layer

Dock component

Spotlight system

MenuBar component

Context menu system

Persistent layout manager

Z-index focus management

Global keyboard shortcut manager

All windows must be independent components but controlled by a central window store.

The system must allow:

Multiple windows open simultaneously

Focus switching

Z-index reordering

Dragging across screen

Resizing with constraints

Snap to screen edges

Minimize to dock

Restore from dock

Close animation

Bring-to-front on click

UI DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Design Theme:

Background: Soft cream tone (#F5EFE6 range)

Subtle beige gradient layers

Very soft shadow depth

16–20px rounded corners

Muted accent colors (terracotta, sage, dusty blue)

Light grain texture overlay

Minimal border strokes

Soft blur glassmorphism for dock and top bar

Typography:

System UI font stack

Strong hierarchy

Generous whitespace

Editorial but modern

No hard contrasts. No overly saturated colors.

DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE

Top Menu Bar:

Brand name (Dzakwan)

Menu items (File, Edit, View style reinterpretation or Projects, About, Lab, Contact)

Right-side status icons (search, theme toggle, system time optional)

Desktop:

Draggable icons (Projects, About, Lab, Leadership, Contact)

Optional right-click context menu

Dock:

Floating translucent panel

App icons

Hover magnification animation

Minimized windows appear here

APPLICATION WINDOWS TO BUILD

Projects App:

Grid or table of projects

Click opens Project Detail window

Sidebar optional filter

Tag system

Role, year, tech stack badges

Project Detail Window:

Hero image area

Info panel

Problem section

Approach section

Technical Implementation

Result & Impact

Scrollable area using Radix ScrollArea

About App:

Sidebar navigation

Sections (Who I Am, What I Build, Philosophy, Skills)

Clean editorial layout

Lab App:

Experimental UI components

Animation demos

Interactive components

Possibly embedded demos

Leadership App:

Timeline layout

Structured highlights

Card-based design

Contact App:

Contact links

CV download button

Clean minimal form optional

Spotlight:

Opens via keyboard shortcut

Search apps, projects, commands

Instant open behavior

ANIMATION PRINCIPLES

All motion must follow:

Natural spring curves

No linear transitions

Subtle fade + scale on window open

Smooth dock hover magnification

Dragging with frictionless feel

Minimize animation toward dock

Snap animation with visual guide overlay

Performance must remain smooth at 60fps.

PERSISTENCE SYSTEM

Using Dexie (IndexedDB), store:

Window positions

Window size

Active apps

Last opened apps

Theme selection

Desktop layout

On reload, layout must restore.

ENGINEERING STANDARDS

Strict TypeScript

Clean folder architecture

Feature-based structure

Reusable components

No inline messy logic

Strong separation between UI and state logic

Clean animation orchestration

Accessibility via Radix primitives

END GOAL

The final result must feel like:

A real lightweight operating system inside a browser

Polished and intentional

Premium and elegant

Calm but powerful

Technical and design-driven

Not gimmicky

Not cartoonish

Not copied from macOS

A product-level experience

This is not a template portfolio.
This is a crafted interactive system.
